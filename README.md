# Mechanic-On-The-Way

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Vehicle breakdown in the middle of the road becomes problematic if faced out of your known town. Also, nowadays it puts safety, especially for women, in danger, because of the increase in the cases of defrauding. Even if the customer has contact details of the mechanic, he/she might not be available at that time, or can be out of reach. Everyone must have experienced such situation once in their life, and this problem affects all the people who have, or travel in an automobile. 
Mechanics on the way is a web application which manages customer and mechanics. It includes registration of mechanics and will store all information in database which can be accessed by customer as well as admin. The software has ability to give unique ids to customers as well as mechanics to ensure proper working between the modules.
